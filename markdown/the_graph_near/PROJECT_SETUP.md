## ðŸ¤” What's The Graph for NEAR?

Prior to embarking on this learning pathway we recommend completing both the NEAR and The Graph pathways. They aren't required, but you will probably find the background useful as you move through these lessons.

Also in this pathway you will find reference to Ceramic Network and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). The NEAR contract we will interact with in this pathway is a DID Registry contract that associates a DID with a NEAR account and stores that relationship on NEAR. Our subgraph will listen to and index the NEAR blockchain for this contract. We will then be able to query it and use the DID we get to retrieve information from Ceramic Network that corresponds to that account enabling creation of things like member profile directories.

If you're already familiar with The Graph, NEAR, and Ceramic and are ready to start coding subgraphs for NEAR, feel free to skip the suggested readings.

If you want to read more about The Graph and it's support for NEAR Protocol we've curated some great resources to help you get started:

- We wrote [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/sprngtheory/status/1425137466789486592) to explain The Graph without technical jargon. It's a great place to start!
- Project documentation is not always the best place to start. However, The Graph is an exception. They have very well-written and approachable docs. [Give them a read](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction).
- NEAR support for The Graph is in beta and while many of the concepts are similar to what is required on other chains, it does have nuances of its own. The Graph's docs for [NEAR support](https://thegraph.com/docs/supported-networks/near) are recommended.
- Ceramic Network is a decentralized, open source platform for creating, hosting, and sharing streams of data. Recommend reading Ceramic's [overview](https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/advanced/overview/)
- More of a visual learner? The rock star of blockchain Youtube - Finematics - have the perfect video for you: [Binge it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gC7xJ_98r8).
- You're still here?? We have curated more links on [Figment Learn](https://learn.figment.io/protocols/thegraph). Knock yourself out!
