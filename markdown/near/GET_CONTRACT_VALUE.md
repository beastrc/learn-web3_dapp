Our Contract is on-chain, and we're going to learn how to fetch the message stored on the contract.

# üèãÔ∏è Challenge

{% hint style="tip" %}
In `pages/api/near/getter.ts`, implement the default function. You must replace any instances of `undefined` with working code to accomplish this.
{% endhint %}

**Take a few minutes to figure this out.**

```tsx
//...
  try {
    const config = configFromNetwork(network);
    const near = await connect(config);
    const account = await near.account(accountId);
    // Using viewFunction, try to call the contract
    const response = undefined;
    return res.status(200).json(response)
  }
//...
```

Still not sure how to do this? No problem! The solution is below so you don't get stuck.

# üòÖ Solution

```tsx
// solution
//...
  try {
    const config = configFromNetwork(network);
    const near = await connect(config);
    const account = await near.account(accountId);
    const response = await account.viewFunction(
        accountId,
        "get_greeting",
        {account_id: accountId}
    );
    return res.status(200).json(response)
  }
//...
```

**What happened in the code above?**

- We're calling the `viewFunction` method of our account, passing to it:
  - The `contractId`, which is the same as our account name. This is because the contract has been deployed to our account!
  - The name of the method we want to call, here `get_greeting`
  - The name of the argument expected by `get_greeting`, which is `account_id`.
- Finally, we can send the `response` back to the client-side as JSON.

# ‚úÖ Make sure it works

Once the code in `pages/api/near/getter.ts` is complete, click the **Get Message** button to fetch the value stored in the smart contract and display it on the page.

# üèÅ Conclusion

Now, time for the last challenge! Time to modify the state of the contract and thus the state of the blockchain. Let's go!
