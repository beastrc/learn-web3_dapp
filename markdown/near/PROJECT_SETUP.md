# ðŸ§© DataHub API keys

To make use of the Pathway content, you will require a DataHub account and a valid API key to access NEAR via DataHub's infrastructure.
You will need to [sign up for a DataHub account](https://auth.figment.io/sign_up) and verify your email address.

To use your API key you must create a new file named `.env.local` in the project root directory `/learn-web3-dapp/`, copying the contents of the existing `.env.example` file. Your API key needs to be pasted into `.env.local` so that you can authenticate your connections with DataHub.

Your personal API key can be found on the [**DataHub Services Dashboard**](https://datahub.figment.io/). Click on the **NEAR** icon in the list of available protocols and then copy your key as shown below:

You can then paste your personal API key into `.env.local`, as the value for the environment variable `DATAHUB_NEAR_API_KEY`. This will authenticate you and enable you to make JSON-RPC requests to NEAR via DataHub:
