We won't go through the process of reviewing the smart contract code base, compiling it or testing it. We will focus instead on how one can deploy a smart contract using the **ContractKit** library. To do this, we're going to use a pre-compiled smart contract, you can find its Application Binary Interface under `contracts/celo/HelloWorld.json`.

Our contract will be pretty basic. It stores a string on the blockchain and implements two functions:

- The `getName` function returns the name stored on the contract.
- The `setName` function changes the name stored on the contract.

# üèãÔ∏è Challenge

{% hint style="tip" %}
In `pages/api/celo/deploy.ts`, implement the default function. Upload your first smart contract on the **Celo** network. You must replace any instances of `undefined` with working code to accomplish this.
{% endhint %}

**Take a few minutes to figure this out.**

```tsx
//...
  try {
    const {secret, address, network} = req.body;
    const url = getNodeUrl(network);
    const kit = newKit(url);

    kit.addAccount(secret);

    // TODO: Create a transaction to deploy the contract

    const receipt = await tx.waitReceipt();

    res.status(200).json({
        address: receipt?.contractAddress as string,
        hash: receipt.transactionHash
    });
  }
//...
```

Still not sure how to do this? No problem! The solution is below so you don't get stuck.

# üòÖ Solution

```tsx
// solution
//...
  try {
    const {secret, address, network} = req.body;
    const url = getNodeUrl(network);
    const kit = newKit(url);

    kit.addAccount(secret);

    let tx = await kit.sendTransaction({
        from: address,
        data: HelloWorld.bytecode
    });
    const receipt = await tx.waitReceipt();

    res.status(200).json({
        address: receipt?.contractAddress as string,
        hash: receipt.transactionHash
    });
  }
//...
```

**What happened in the code above?**

- We send a transaction using the `sendTransaction` method passing:
  - `from`, the address which will pay the fees for the transaction
  - `data`, the bytecode of our compiled contract using the `bytecode` property of the ABI stored in `contracts/celo/HelloWorld.json`.

# ‚úÖ Make sure it works

Once the code in `pages/api/celo/deploy.ts` is complete, click on **Deploy Contract** to send the transaction (and the compiled smart contract) to Celo.

# üèÅ Conclusion

Now that we have deployed a smart contract, let's learn how to interact with it. In the following tutorials, we will look at how to use both view and change functions.
