Our contract is on-chain, and we're going to learn how to modify the value stored in the state of the contract.

# üèãÔ∏è Challenge

{% hint style="tip" %}
In `pages/api/celo/setter.ts`, implement the default function. You must replace any instances of `undefined` with working code to accomplish this.
{% endhint %}

**Take a few minutes to figure this out.**

```tsx
//...
  try {
    const {secret, newMessage, contract, address, network} = req.body;
    const url = getNodeUrl(network);
    const kit = newKit(url);
    kit.addAccount(secret);

    // Create a new contract instance with the HelloWorld contract info
    const instance = undefined;
    // Call the setName function of our contract
    const txObject = undefined;
    // Send a transaction Object to modify the state of our contract
    let tx = undefined;

    let receipt = await tx.waitReceipt();

    res.status(200).json(receipt.transactionHash);
  }
//...
```

- [**Web3.js eth contract interface**](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.4.0/web3-eth-contract.html)

Still not sure how to do this? No problem! The solution is below so you don't get stuck.

# üòÖ Solution

```tsx
// solution
//...
  try {
    const {secret, newMessage, contract, address, network} = req.body;
    const url = getNodeUrl(network);
    const kit = newKit(url);
    kit.addAccount(secret);

    // Create a new contract instance with the HelloWorld contract info
    const instance = new kit.web3.eth.Contract(
        HelloWorld.abi,
        contract
    );

    const txObject = await instance.methods.setName(newMessage);
    let tx = await kit.sendTransactionObject(txObject, { from: address });

    let receipt = await tx.waitReceipt();

    res.status(200).json(receipt.transactionHash);
  }
//...
```

**What happened in the code above?**

- First, we create a new instance with the HelloWorld contract info.
- Next, we call the `setName` function of our smart contract
- Finally, we create a transaction to execute this function with `sendTransactionObject`, passing in:
  - The transaction object (`txObject`) containing the properly formatted call to the contract method.
  - An object with the `from` property, the address which will pay the fees for the transaction.
- Boom! Wait for confirmation with `waitReceipt` and return the transaction hash to the client-side as JSON.

# ‚úÖ Make sure it works

Once the code in `pages/api/celo/setter.ts` is complete, enter a value into the textinput and click the button to set the value stored in the smart contract.
