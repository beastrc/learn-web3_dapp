In this tutorial we're going to replace the Connect with Metamask we just implemented with a Connect with IDX. But before we can dive in we need to understand few key terms when it comes to Ceramic and decentralized authentication....

# üåä Streams

`Stream` is a basic building block of Ceramic. It is a DAG-based data structure for storing continuous, mutable streams of content on IPFS.
Every stream is identified by an immutable StreamID. When a stream reaches the node, a special function is fired to process it.
This function is called `StreamType`. StreamTypes are responsible for processing data and storing them as commits (which are individual IPFS records).
Every stream needs to specify its StreamType so that Ceramic nodes know how to process them. What is important in terms of authentication is the fact that every `StreamType` implementation is able to specify its own authentication mechanism. For that purpose, most StreamTypes are using DIDs.

# üÜî You DID what?

DIDs is the W3C standard for decentralized identifiers, which describes the standard URI scheme for creating persistent decentralized identifiers (DID). It also specifies how the metadata for a given DID is resolved. As with every standard there can be several implementations, these are called **DID methods**.
Every **DID method** has a method specific URIs that looks like:

```text
did:<method-name>:<method-specific-identifier>
```

There are over 40 different DID methods on the official DID registry. Ceramic currently supports the `3ID` and `Key` DID methods.
We will be using the `3ID` DID method for this tutorial, as it is a powerful DID method that supports multiple keys, key rotations, and revocations.
The `Key` DID Method on the other hand, is tied only to a single crypto key which is not very convenient.

One of the other things that DID methods also describes is a location of where the metadata is stored. This metadata is stored in something that is called `DID document`.
`DID resolver` is a package which is responsible for returning DID document given the URI shown above.
One other missing piece is `DID provider` which is a package that exposes json-rpc interface which allows for the creation and usage of DID.
As an dApp creator you have a choice of using `3id-did-provider` package which is a low-level library. This method is not recommended as it leaves keys management to the application.
On the other had you could use `3ID Connect` which is a DID wallet that makes it easy to creat and use DID without worrying about keys management.
Below picture shows how applications can interact with DID resolvers and DID providers.

That was a lot of important theory to cover! Now let's write some code.

# üì¶ A few new packages

In order to be able to use IDX and 3ID Connect wallet you need to have the following packages installed:

- `@ceramicnetwork/http-client` - An http client for the ceramic network
- `@ceramicstudio/idx` - Javascript implementation of IDX protocol
- `dids` - Library for interacting with DIDs
- `@3id/connect` - 3ID account management service run in iframe.
- `@ceramicnetwork/3id-did-resolver` - DID method that uses the Ceramic network to resolve DID documents

Don't worry, we have you covered! These packages are already installed for you in the `learn-web3-dapp` project.

# üìö From simple connect to decentralized log in

As you probably know authentication allows you to perform extra actions that are not allowed for regular users. In Ceramic when you are authenticated, you can perform such actions as updating data associated to your identity as well as creating genesis commits, signed commits, or decrypting data.

Connecting your Metamask wallet to dApp allows for easy interaction with smart contracts on a given blockchain ie. Ethereum. You can make transactions, query the network, all from the context of the account connected with Metamask. What if you could associate data like name, avatar, social accounts and also application-specific data to your account? In this challenge we will use Ceramic/IDX to log user in using 3ID Connect wallet.

For keeping information about the authenticated user, we use the React Context API and wrap our application with the exposed provider. This allows us to keep the state of the authenticated user in one place. You can see how it is implemented in `components/protocols/ceramic/context/idx.tsx`. You already touched this file in the last step to implement the connect functionality.

# üèãÔ∏è Challenge

{% hint style="tip" %}
In `components/protocols/ceramic/context/idx.tsx`, implement the `login` function.
{% endhint %}

```typescript
// components/protocols/ceramic/context/idx.tsx

const logIn = useCallback(async (): Promise<string> => {
  const address = await connect();

  // Request authentication using 3IDConnect.
  // Find more information here: https://developers.ceramic.network/authentication/3id-did/3id-connect/#4-request-authentication

  // Create provider instance.
  // Find more information here: https://developers.ceramic.network/authentication/3id-did/3id-connect/#5-create-provider-instance

  // Create a DID instance.

  // Set DID instance on HTTP client

  const userDID = undefined;

  // Create IDX instance

  // Get current user's basic profile
  const basicProfile = await getBasicProfile(userDID);

  if (setIsAuthenticated) {
    setIsAuthenticated(true);
  }

  if (setCurrentUserDID) {
    setCurrentUserDID(userDID);
  }
  if (identityStore) {
    await identityStore.setDID(userDID);
  }
  if (basicProfile && setUserData) {
    await setUserData(IdxSchema.BasicProfile, basicProfile);
  }

  return userDID;
}, [setIsAuthenticated]);
```

# ü§î What happened here?

First, we create an instance of an Ethereum provider and tie it to a specific address that we receive after connecting a wallet to our website.

Then we make `threeIdConnect` to connect to this provider. Once this is done, we create a new instance of DID for which we specify a provider and a resolver. The resolver is responsible for returning a DID document given the DID string. The provider is responsible for providing a JSON-RPC interface that allows us to create and use a DID.

Then we set the DID instance to the Ceramic client.

We then call authenticate, which will start the authentication process. A popup will appear on the top right corner which will prompt you to create or update your existing identity. You will need to sign a transaction using Metamask, then your DID should be associated with your Ethereum account.
Finally, we create an IDX instance with the authenticated Ceramic client instance and any aliases that we want to use.
