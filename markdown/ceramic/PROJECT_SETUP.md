# üè∫ What is Ceramic?

Most of the information on today‚Äôs internet is stored in **walled garden databases**, not accessible to the outside world. If you don‚Äôt have direct access to database of if there is no API exposed by the application, you might need to go and look around somewhere else. This results in data being duplicated and locked away in many different databases.

What if there was one place where you could get all the relevant content you need? What if content was open sourced the same way code is open-sourced using GitHub? That‚Äôs exactly the promise of Ceramic. **Ceramic is a platform for creating, hosting and sharing streams of data in decentralized way.** Open-source content which can be easily shared between applications using just one SDK rather than dozens of different external APIs. But always secured using your private keys.

# üÜî What is IDX?

IDX is a multi-platform **identity protocol** that replaces centralized user tables with a decentralized alternative. It allows to build up a unified digital identity consisting of all their data while enabling developers to break down silos and freely share a users' data between applications.

Read more on the [official IDX docs](https://developers.idx.xyz/learn/welcome/). It has some great diagrams and a glossary.

# ü§ì Stream, StreamTypes and DIDs

Two important concepts with Ceramic network are **Streams** and **StreamTypes**. Streams are nothing more than append only log of commits stored on IPFS. StreamTypes on the other hand are functions which are applied to those logs.

One important responsibility of StreamTypes is authorisation of users to perform write operations to stream. Different StreamTypes might need different levels of authorisation. One of the authentication mechanisms that StreamTypes supports is **DIDs**, the W3C standard for decentralized identifiers. DIDs are used to associate globally-unique, platform-agnostic string identifier with a DID document where all the data required for signature verification and encryption is stored.

This DID is essential to IDX. With IDX there no more need for juggling many API Keys for different external services to get access to data generate by users on different applications.
