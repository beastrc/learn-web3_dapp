{% hint style="tip" %}
We recommend completing both the [Solana 101 pathway](https://learn.figment.io/protocols/solana) and [Build a Solana Wallet](https://learn.figment.io/pathways/solana-wallet) before continuing. A working knowledge of [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and [TypeScript/JavaScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is also recommended.

# 🦺 Important information for your safety

During this Pathway, we will provide you with an opportunity to use the Solana [mainnet-beta cluster](https://docs.solana.com/clusters#mainnet-beta) (hereafter referred to as "mainnet") to perform token swaps with [Jupiter](https://jup.ag), a liquidity aggregator for Solana - which means that **actual funds may be used**. This is **not** a requirement for completing the Pathway.

Be aware that during step 4 of the Pathway ("Wallet implementation"), we will explain how to identify & use the private keys of Solana keypairs. Solana keypairs can be created using the Solana CLI, or with the JavaScript API, or even by using a browser extension wallet such as [Phantom](https://phantom.app).

You should **never** share your private keys with anyone. The simplest and most secure approach to this issue is to create an keypair entirely for the purpose of the following tutorials. The wallet component used in several steps of the Pathway has a toggle switch between "Mock" and "Live". When the toggle is set to "Live", you will be able to provide a [private key](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Keypair.html). This private key is then kept in the local storage of your web browser, so that you do not need to enter it multiple times. If you are not already familiar with it, read more about [web browser local storage](https://blog.logrocket.com/localstorage-javascript-complete-guide/) to understand where and how this data is kept.

Before proceeding, it is extremely important for you to understand that **if you provide the private key of a Solana account containing mainnet SOL to the wallet component in the Pathway, you are _potentially_ risking the full amount of SOL in that account**. Essentially, whatever funds the liquidation bot has access to can be swapped at any time while the bot is running, without user intervention. This is the power of private keys.

# ♻️ A word on swaps

Because we are working with some fairly new technology, there are some gaps in functionality between the Solana devnet and mainnet. There is quite a large discrepancy in the price of USDC tokens between devnet and mainnet, which we will explain in more detail when it becomes relevant.

Note that in order to perform _any_ swaps on Solana mainnet using this project, you must:

- Own a funded account on mainnet containing an amount of SOL and the USDC SPL token.
- Be on Step 7, "Liquidation bot implementation".
- Toggle the wallet component from "Mock" to "Live", then copy and paste the private key of your funded account into the textinput of the **live** wallet component.
- Finally you can switch the wallet component from devnet to mainnet. This will present you with an alert, warning you that you're going live on mainnet with real economic exposure.

If this doesn't make sense yet, don't worry. This is just a heads up. It will make more sense in the context of the Pathway implementation 😁

# 🧑‍💻 Install the Pyth client

{% hint style="tip" %}
This Pathway will only cover use of `@pythnetwork/client`. There are also Rust-, Python-, and EVM-based clients. Refer to the [list of available client libraries](https://docs.pyth.network/consumers/client-libraries) in the Pyth documentation for more.
{% endhint %}

In order to use Pyth, you will need to install the TypeScript/JavaScript library for off-chain applications. It provides the tools to do things like displaying the Pyth price on a website. Whether you're using Gitpod or a local clone of the repo, the installation procedure is the same. Run the terminal command below inside the root directory of the project (`learn-web3-dapp/`) :

```text
yarn add @pythnetwork/client
```

# 👻 Install the Phantom wallet extension

Turn your favorite browser into a Web 3 enabled crypto wallet!

Go to <https://phantom.app> and click on the "Add to ..." button which will auto-detect your browser and redirect you to the appropriate extension page:

- Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/phantom-app/
- Chrome / Brave / Edge: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/phantom/bfnaelmomeimhlpmgjnjophhpkkoljpa?hl=en

Optionally, check out <https://phantom.app/security> to learn more about the security features of Phantom.

# 🧩 DataHub API keys

If you wish to make use of the Pathway content using DataHub, you will need a DataHub account and a valid API key to access Solana via DataHub's infrastructure. [Sign up for a DataHub account](https://datahub-beta.figment.io/signup) and verify your email address. Once you have logged in to DataHub, you will need to create a new app and select the Solana protocol (because Pyth uses Solana).

Click "Create New App":

![DataHub API keys Image 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/figment-networks/learn-web3-dapp/main/markdown/__images__/pyth/dh_api_1.png?raw=true)

Type in a name for your app, select the **Staging** environment, then click on the **Solana** icon in the list of available protocols. \
Click "Create app" when you're finished:

![DataHub API keys Image 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/figment-networks/learn-web3-dapp/main/markdown/__images__/pyth/dh_api_2.png?raw=true)

You can now find your API key on the Overview tab of the app on the [**DataHub Dashboard**](https://datahub-beta.figment.io/apps):

![DataHub API keys Image 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/figment-networks/learn-web3-dapp/main/markdown/__images__/pyth/dh_api_3.png?raw=true)

To use your API key, you should copy the contents of the `.env.example` file located in the project root directory (`/learn-web3-dapp/.env.example`) into a new file named `.env.local` (`/learn-web3-dapp/.env.local`). Also, since this file will contain your API key, we have already added it to the `.gitignore`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Easily duplicate the file with the terminal command `cp .env.example .env.local`!
{% endhint %}

You can then paste your unique API key into `.env.local`, as the value for the environment variable `DATAHUB_SOLANA_API_KEY`. This will authenticate you and enable you to make JSON-RPC requests to Solana via DataHub. **The API key shown below is only an example and cannot be used to access DataHub**.

```yaml
# DataHub API keys
DATAHUB_AVALANCHE_API_KEY=
DATAHUB_CELO_API_KEY=
DATAHUB_NEAR_API_KEY=
DATAHUB_POLKADOT_API_KEY=
DATAHUB_POLYGON_API_KEY=
DATAHUB_SECRET_API_KEY=
DATAHUB_SOLANA_API_KEY=81436edcf907b0fbb8493d281cdff5af
DATAHUB_TEZOS_API_KEY=
```

{% hint style="tip" %}
If the Next.js development server was running at the time you changed the environment variable's value, you will need to restart the Next.js server to make it aware of the new value. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the Next.js server is running, then restart it with the command `yarn dev`.
{% endhint %}
