Before we start working on making swaps with actual tokens on the Solana devnet, we're going to create a mock implementation as a starting point. For this implementation, we will also link the buy & sell orders to a manual button press for testing.

Then we're going to work with some additional code libraries to perform token swaps on a Solana based DEX. This is where we will be able to swap our SOL for some USDC using the Orca pools on devnet so that we can begin using the liquidation bot (without risking any real funds). We'll go over the `OrcaSwapClient` which will be used to swap SOL for SPL tokens.

On mainnet, we have access to the more powerful Jupiter SDK where we can swap directly without needing to keep track of intermediate pairs. Again, the mainnet enabled code is primarily for illustration and should not be used without proper testing and understanding the inherent risks.

# üß± Adding orders to the order book

We went over the `addMockOrder` and `addDevnetOrder` functions in `components/protocols/pyth/lib/wallet.tsx` in a previous step. With a mock transaction, we use the Jupiter SDK to ensure the prices we're getting are indicative of mainnet. We are also passing in an `Order` object and getting back a `SwapResult`, but no swap is actually performed. The returned `txIds` array contains the identifier "**mockTransaction\_**" and a 6-digit random number. As part of the `addMockOrder` function, we also update the mock wallet balances.

`addOrder` will use the appropriate function to put the order into the order book.

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/wallet.tsx

// ...
const addOrder = useCallback(
  async (order: Order) => {
    console.log('addOrder', useLive, order, cluster);
    let result: SwapResult;
    switch (true) {
      case useLive && cluster === 'mainnet-beta': {
        result = await addMainnetOrder(order);
        break;
      }
      case useLive && cluster === 'devnet': {
        result = await addDevnetOrder(order);
        break;
      }
      case !useLive:
      default: {
        result = await addMockOrder(order);
      }
    }
    const extendedOrder: Order & SwapResult = {...order, ...result};
    setOrderbook((_orderBook) => [extendedOrder, ..._orderBook]);

    mutate(); // Refresh balance.
  },
  [useLive, cluster, keyPair, devnetToMainnetPriceRatioRef],
);
// ...
```

# ü™Ç Getting an airdrop on Solana devnet

If you already know how to fund your wallet with an airdrop, go ahead and get some SOL. More is better, but make sure to have at least 2 SOL for testing the liquidation bot.

At this point you will need to acquire some SOL to perform swaps on devnet. The simplest way to do this is by visiting [solfaucet.com](https://solfaucet.com/). Copy the public key of your keypair, and paste it into the textarea on the faucet site. Click on the "Devnet" button and in a few seconds, you will have some SOL to play with on devnet.

{% hint style="tip" %}
You can airdrop **a maximum of 2 SOL per request** using this method. Larger amounts will simply not work, if you view the transaction on the block explorer, you will see a Memo written to the blockchain that says (for example): `request too large; req: ‚óé10, cap: ‚óé2`.
{% endhint %}

# üé† Playground time

Take a few minutes and get comfortable with the mock swap process. Just switch the wallet over to "Mock", then click "Reset Wallet" to return the balances to their default amounts of 10 SOL and 1,400 USDC. You can then click on the **SOL -> ORCA** button located just above the Order book to perform a single trade, based on the best available route reported by Jupiter. Notice that the Transaction link is displayed as "mockT", and does not link to a valid transaction on solscan.io.

Switch to the Live wallet, then swap some tokens around on devnet! If you don't have some ORCA in your devnet wallet before starting up the bot in the next step, it won't like the fact that you're trying to swap the entire amount of ORCA in your initial swap. Also keep in mind that the token values on the devnet Orca pools are a little out of line with the mainnet values, and you'll notice that some swaps can fail due to an insufficient USDC balance. To prevent this from being an issue, we're catching the errors and displaying failed swaps on the order book.

The way we've tuned the liquidation bot is actually based on the mainnet token values, so don't be alarmed if there are some failed swaps. It's a great way to learn about how the swaps work behind the scenes if you care to dig into it, but we'll leave out those details so that you don't get overwhelmed.

# üß± Building the Exchange component

Two files to be aware of here: The Exchange component `components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx` which is being rendered on the right side of the screen and the helper code for performing swaps on devnet or mainnet, located in `components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts`.

You'll notice that we have only included the wallet and the order book for this step. We've removed the chart component for now, but it will come back in the next step when we bring everything together!

# üöö Importing dependencies

We went over imports earlier in the pathway, the only new ones to be aware of here are the Orca and Jupiter SDKs.

- [`@orca-so/sdk`](https://github.com/orca-so/typescript-sdk#orca-typescript-sdk) the Orca SDK enables us to create our `OrcaSwapClient`
- [`@jup-ag/core`](https://docs.jup.ag/jupiter-core/using-jupiter-core#usage) the Jupiter SDK enables us to create our `JupiterSwapClient`

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts

import {Cluster, Connection, Keypair, PublicKey} from '@solana/web3.js';
import {getOrca, OrcaPoolConfig, Network} from '@orca-so/sdk';
import {Jupiter, RouteInfo, TOKEN_LIST_URL} from '@jup-ag/core';
```

# üè¶ Associated Token Accounts

Working with SPL tokens on Solana can be a little intimidating at first, but we'll quickly go over the fundamentals so you're up to speed. You can get more details from the [Solana docs on the topic](https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account) if you're interested. This process is handled transparently by the Orca and Jupiter SDKs when swapping tokens.

An Associated Token Account ("ATA") is an account owned by the SPL Token Program, associated with your public key. It is where SPL tokens of a specific mint address are stored and the balances can be viewed on most Solana block explorers. [solscan.io](https://solscan.io) has a tab on the account display page which will list your owned token balances.

Without going into too much detail, an ATA is required for Solana users to hold SPL tokens. The address of the Token Account can be derived from a public key and the mint address of the token. All we're doing here is illustrating the process using a couple of `Token` class methods: `getAssociatedTokenAddress` and `createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction`. You don't need to read the code block below unless you want to see how those functions are being used. The [Solana Cookbook](https://solanacookbook.com) is a useful resource for code snippets related to SPL tokens.

`transactionSolscan` is just a helper function we've provided to easily turn a transaction signature (or "hash") into a usable link to the solscan.io block explorer. You can find it in `components/protocols/pyth/lib/index.ts`.

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts

// ...
  async makeATA(mintPubkey: PublicKey) {
    let ata = await Token.getAssociatedTokenAddress(
      ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, // always ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
      TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, // always TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
      mintPubkey, // mint PublicKey
      this.keypair.publicKey, // owner
    );
    let tx = new Transaction().add(
      Token.createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction(
        ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, // always ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
        TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, // always TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
        mintPubkey, // mint
        ata, // ata
        this.keypair.publicKey, // owner of token account
        this.keypair.publicKey, // fee payer
      ),
    );
    console.log(`ATA for ${mintPubkey}: ${ata.toBase58()}`);
    const txHash = await this.connection.sendTransaction(tx, [this.keypair]);
    return `${transactionSolscan('devnet', txHash)}` as String;
  }
// ...
```

---

# üéÅ Wrapping SOL

Wrapped SOL ("wSOL") is an SPL token. Sometimes it is necessary to be able to swap between SOL and other SPL tokens. We'll need an ATA for wSOL to be able to send this transaction. In most cases, the creation of this ATA is handled behind the scenes but we're exposing it here for your learning. The "Sync Native" instruction being sent to the SPL Token Program is what keeps the wSOL balance synced with the SOL balance of the ATA. You can pass an amount and the public key of the ATA to send the SOL to as the parameters.

As you can see, we are simply creating a transaction by adding instructions to the System Program and the SPL Token program. The function returns a solscan.io URL for the transaction so that details are at your fingertips.

Also, when sending the transaction you must pass an array containing the signing keypairs. The reason you're seeing `this.keypair` is because the `wrapSOL` method exists inside of the `OrcaSwapClient` class.

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts

  async wrapSOL(amount: number, ata: PublicKey) {
    let tx = new Transaction().add(
      // Transfer SOL
      SystemProgram.transfer({
        fromPubkey: this.keypair.publicKey,
        toPubkey: ata,
        lamports: amount,
      }),
      new TransactionInstruction({
        keys: [
          {
            pubkey: ata,
            isSigner: false,
            isWritable: true,
          },
        ],
        data: Buffer.from(new Uint8Array([17])),
        programId: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
      }),
    );
    const txHash = await this.connection.sendTransaction(tx, [
      this.keypair,
      this.keypair,
    ]);
    return `${transactionSolscan('mainnet-beta', txHash)}` as String;
  }
```

# üìà Buy & Sell Orders

We need to define what an Order looks like so that we can work with it in code. This is a data type which contains information about an order, including the tokens being swapped and the size of the order. This interface is defined in `components/protocols/pyth/lib/wallet.ts`.

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/wallet.ts

// Define the interface for an Order
interface Order {
  side: 'buy' | 'sell';
  size: number;
  price: number;
  fromToken: string;
  toToken: string;
}
```

To tie it together, we need to define the interface for SPL Tokens as well as our own SwapResult. This `TokenI` interface is for mainnet swaps using Jupiter.

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts

// Token interface
export interface TokenI {
  chainId: number; // 101,
  address: string; // '8f9s1sUmzUbVZMoMh6bufMueYH1u4BJSM57RCEvuVmFp',
  symbol: string; // 'TRUE',
  name: string; // 'TrueSight',
  decimals: number; // 9,
  logoURI: string; // 'https://i.ibb.co/pKTWrwP/true.jpg',
  tags: string[]; // [ 'utility-token', 'capital-token' ]
}

// SwapResult interface
export interface SwapResult {
  inAmount: number;
  outAmount: number;
  txIds: string[];
  error?: any;
  timestamp: number; // Unix timestamp
}
```

We also need to keep track of the total worth of our assets based on the current market price, the React `useState` hook is an natural choice for this. We will also set up some more app state to handle the details of the orders. This is occurring in the `Exchange` component being displayed on the right side of the page:

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx

// State for tracking user worth with current Market Price.
const [worth, setWorth] = useState({initial: 0, current: 0});

// yieldExpectation is the amount of EMA to trigger buy/sell signals
const [yieldExpectation, setYield] = useState<number>(0.001);
const [orderSize, setOrderSize] = useState<number>(20); // USDC
const [price, setPrice] = useState<number | undefined>(undefined);
const [symbol, setSymbol] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined);
const [orderBook, setOrderbook] = useState<Order[]>([]);
```

Take a look at how we can update the current worth:

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx

useEffect(() => {
  // Update the current worth each price update.
  const currentWorth = wallet?.sol_balance * price! + wallet.usdc_balance;
  setWorth({...worth, current: currentWorth});
}, [price, orderSizeUSDC, setPrice]);
```

Let's break down the `OrcaSwapClient` to understand what's actually happening on Solana devnet when an order is executed:

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts
export class OrcaSwapClient {
  constructor(
    public readonly keypair: Keypair,
    public readonly connection: Connection,
  ) {}
```

The class constructor defines the `Keypair` and `Connection` as both _public_ and _readonly_ - this means we can trust that this data isn't being altered midway through the function. It's a mix of best practices and defensive programming üòâ.

```typescript
// components/protocola/pyth/lib/swap.ts

  /**
   * @param size The amount of token to swap;
   * @returns TxIds, inAmount, outAmount
   */
  async sell(size: number): Promise<SwapResult> {
    const orca = getOrca(this.connection, Network.DEVNET);
    const orcaSOLPool = orca.getPool(OrcaPoolConfig.ORCA_SOL);
    const solToken = orcaSOLPool.getTokenB();
    const solAmount = new Decimal(size);
    const orcaUSDCPool = orca.getPool(OrcaPoolConfig.ORCA_USDC);
    const orcaToken = orcaSOLPool.getTokenA();
    const usdcToken = orcaUSDCPool.getTokenB();
    // Setting slippage lower is not recommended as it can cause swaps to fail
    const slippage = new Decimal(5.0);

    // Swap SOL -> ORCA
    const quote1 = await orcaSOLPool.getQuote(solToken, solAmount, slippage);
    const orcaQuoteAmount = quote1.getMinOutputAmount();
    console.log(
      `Swap ${solAmount.toString()} SOL for at least ${orcaQuoteAmount.toNumber()} ORCA`,
    );
    const swapPayload = await orcaSOLPool.swap(
      this.keypair,
      solToken,
      solAmount,
      orcaQuoteAmount,
    );
    const swap1TxId = await swapPayload.execute();

    // Swap ORCA -> USDC
    const quote2 = await orcaUSDCPool.getQuote(
      orcaToken,
      orcaQuoteAmount,
      slippage,
    );
    const usdcQuoteAmount = quote2.getMinOutputAmount();
    console.log(
      `Swap ${orcaQuoteAmount.toNumber()} ORCA for at least ${usdcQuoteAmount.toNumber()} USDC`,
    );
    const swap2Payload = await orcaUSDCPool.swap(
      this.keypair,
      orcaToken,
      orcaQuoteAmount,
      usdcQuoteAmount,
    );
    const swap2TxId = await swap2Payload.execute();

    return {
      txIds: [swap1TxId, swap2TxId],
      inAmount: solAmount.toNumber() * SOL_DECIMAL,
      outAmount: usdcQuoteAmount.toNumber() * USDC_DECIMAL,
    } as SwapResult;
  }
```

The `buy` and `sell` methods are quite similar - taking a `size` parameter. In both cases, we start by getting an instance of the Orca SDK with the `getOrca` method, which gives us access to the `getPool` method. From there, we can use the `getTokenB` method to be sure we're passing the correct mint address for the SOL token to the `getQuote` method (keep in mind that `getQuote` is asynchronous and returns a Promise, so we need to `await` the result).
It's important to get a minimum output amount for the quoted swap. So important in fact, there is a specific method to do just that: `getMinOutputAmount` returns the smallest amount of ORCA tokens that the user will recieve for the quoted swap, and in the case that the swap produces less than this amount the transaction will revert. This protects the user from sudden changes in liquidity and slippage. These are advanced topics we won't dive into here, but this particular pattern is quite easy to implement with the Orca SDK. Just remember to program defensively and keep your users in mind üòÄ.

We can now supply all the necessary parameters to the `swap` method on the Pool instance. The [type definitions](https://github.com/orca-so/typescript-sdk/blob/d231754ef33d21b6a60858996cd93450807f61f3/src/public/pools/types.ts#L91) tell us what we need to know about this method. It will "Perform a swap from the input type to the other token in the pool. Fee for the transaction will be paid by the owner's wallet." The `swap` returns the transaction signature of the swap instruction. This can be sent to the Solana cluster for processing [via the `execute` method from the Orca SDK's `TransactionPayload` type](https://github.com/orca-so/typescript-sdk/blob/d231754ef33d21b6a60858996cd93450807f61f3/src/public/utils/models/instruction.ts#L25).
Both `buy` and `sell` return the same values: The transaction IDs of both swaps to and from ORCA tokens contained in an array, and the amount of tokens in and out.

Let's also break down the `JupiterSwapClient` to understand what's happening on Solana mainnet when an order is executed:

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts

export class JupiterSwapClient {
  private jupiter: Jupiter;

  constructor(
    jupiter: Jupiter,
    public readonly tokenA: Token,
    public readonly tokenB: Token,
    public readonly keypair: Keypair,
  ) {
    this.jupiter = jupiter;
  }
```

The class constructor defines the `Token` and `Connection` instances as both _public_ and _readonly_. This means we can trust that this data isn't being altered midway through the function. It's a mix of best practices and defensive programming üòâ. The `jupiter` instance is set as private in the upper scope.

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts

  static async initialize(
    connection: Connection,
    cluster: Cluster,
    keypair: Keypair,
    tokenAMintAddress: String, // Token to buy
    tokenBMintAddress: String, // token to sell
  ) {
    const jupiter = await Jupiter.load({connection, cluster, user: keypair});
    const tokens: Token[] = await (await fetch(TOKEN_LIST_URL[cluster])).json(); // Fetch token list from Jupiter API
    const inputToken = tokens.find((t) => t.address == tokenAMintAddress); // Buy token
    const outputToken = tokens.find((t) => t.address == tokenBMintAddress); // Sell token
    console.log('Input token:', inputToken);
    console.log('Output token:', outputToken);
    console.log('Keypair:', keypair);
    console.log(connection, cluster);
    if (!inputToken || !outputToken) {
      throw new Error('Token not found');
    }

    return new JupiterSwapClient(jupiter, inputToken, outputToken, keypair);
  }
```

The `initialize` function sets up the connection to Jupiter using the `load` method from the Jupiter SDK. It also gets the token list for the Solana cluster we're using (mainnet in this case). We've included the console logging so you can take a look at the public keys and inspect the keypair if you want to. We'll return an instance of the `JupiterSwapClient` containing the initialized values.

Next, let's have a look at the `getRoutes` method, which is responsible for determining the best route across multiple DEXes to perform the token swap for the given amount of the `inputToken`. As you can see we're using the `computeRoutes` method from the Jupiter SDK, passing it the token addresses, the input amount in Lamports, a value for slippage and a boolean value for `shouldFetchRoutes`. The best quote is logged at the end, with the entire `routes` object being returned. The `routesInfos` array contans all of the possible routes aggregated by Jupiter. Pretty awesome üòé!

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts

  async getRoutes({
    inputToken,
    outputToken,
    inputAmount,
    slippage,
  }: {
    inputToken?: Token;
    outputToken?: Token;
    inputAmount: number;
    slippage: number;
  }) {
    if (!inputToken || !outputToken) {
      return null;
    }

    console.log('Getting routes');
    const inputAmountLamports = inputToken
      ? Math.round(inputAmount * 10 ** inputToken.decimals)
      : 0; // Lamports based on token decimals
    const routes =
      inputToken && outputToken
        ? await this.jupiter.computeRoutes(
            new PublicKey(inputToken.address),
            new PublicKey(outputToken.address),
            inputAmountLamports,
            slippage,
            true,
          )
        : null;

    if (routes && routes.routesInfos) {
      console.log('Possible number of routes:', routes.routesInfos.length);
      console.log('Best quote: ', routes.routesInfos[0].outAmount);
      return routes;
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  }
```

Next we have the `buy` and `sell` methods which leverage `getRoutes` and then return the value of the `executeSwap` method:

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts

  // USDC -> SOL
  async buy(size: number) {
    const routes = await this.getRoutes({
      inputToken: this.tokenB, // USDC
      outputToken: this.tokenA, // SOL
      inputAmount: size, // 1 unit in UI
      slippage: 1, // 1% slippage
    });
    console.log('Routes:', routes);
    if (routes?.routesInfos) {
      console.log('Best Route', routes.routesInfos[0]);
      return this.executeSwap(routes?.routesInfos[0]);
    } else {
      throw new Error('Route not found');
    }
  }
  // SOL -> USDC
  async sell(size: number) {
    const routes = await this.getRoutes({
      inputToken: this.tokenA,
      outputToken: this.tokenB,
      inputAmount: size, // 1 unit in UI
      slippage: 1, // 1% slippage
    });
    if (routes?.routesInfos) {
      console.log('Best Route', routes.routesInfos[0]);
      return this.executeSwap(routes?.routesInfos[0]);
    } else {
      throw new Error('Route not found');
    }
  }
```

The `executeSwap` method is the last piece of functionality we need to make our swaps. It's essentially just a wrapper for the Jupiter `exchange` method with some additional logging:

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts
  async executeSwap(route: RouteInfo) {
    // Prepare execute exchange
    const {execute} = await this.jupiter.exchange({
      route,
    });
    // Execute swap
    const swapResult: any = await execute(); // Force any to ignore TS misidentifying SwapResult type

    if (swapResult.error) {
      console.log(swapResult.error);
      return {...swapResult, txIds: [swapResult.txId]}; // fit the swapResult interface
    } else {
      console.log(`https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${swapResult.txid}`);
      console.log(
        `inputAddress=${swapResult.inputAddress.toString()} outputAddress=${swapResult.outputAddress.toString()}`,
      );
      console.log(
        `inputAmount=${swapResult.inputAmount} outputAmount=${swapResult.outputAmount}`,
      );
    }
    return {
      txIds: [swapResult.txid],
      inAmount: swapResult.inputAmount,
      outAmount: swapResult.outputAmount,
    };
  }
```

# üß™ Testing individual buy and sell orders

We've encapsulated the indvidual buy and sell buttons into their own component, which is included in `components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx`.

# üìñ The order book

The order book is necessary to keep track of the buy and sell orders we're going to be generating. When the liquidation bot is running, orders will be happening frequently. Luckily for us, antd has a flexible table component with built in pagination so we don't even need to program that part ourselves.

Before doing this on devnet, give it a try using the mock wallet! You'll be able to see the details of an order:

- The Transactions column will contain links to view the actual swap transactions on the [solscan.io](https://solscan.io) block explorer
- "Side" indicates whether the order was a buy or sell
- You can easily interpret the outgoing and incoming tokens and amounts

![The Order Book](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/figment-networks/learn-web3-dapp/main/markdown/__images__/pyth/order_book.png?raw=true)

You might notice there's a discrepancy in the devnet token values. This is unfortunately beyond our control. The mock swaps and mainnet swaps use the true values from Jupiter.

Let's take a quick look at the Table in the return value of `components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx` to better understand how the order book is being rendered. The antd Table component takes an _array of objects_ for the `columns`, each of these objects has a `title`, `dataIndex` and `key` - optionally we can use the `render` method to add whatever additional React fragments we need, for example: Mapping the transaction IDs to a link pointing to the correct page on solscan.io, or changing the color of the tags we use to display the amounts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember to wrap the return values here in [React fragments](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html) (`<> </>`) to avoid trouble with rendering, since they're being rendered within an existing `<div>`!
{% endhint %}

```tsx
// components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx

            .find((l: string) => l.startsWith('Program log: Error'))
            .replace('Program log: Error: ', ''); // make the error short.

# üèãÔ∏è Challenge

{% hint style="tip" %}
In `components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx`, finish implementing the RxJS `map` **return values** to determine what happens when a buy or sell signal is resolved. You must replace the instances of `undefined` to accomplish this.
{% endhint %}

**Take a few minutes to figure this out**

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx

        //...
        Rx.map((val: number) => {
          if (val > 0) {
            // Buy.
            const orderSizeSupposedTo =
              val *
              (cluster === 'devnet'
                ? orderSizeUSDC.devnet
                : orderSizeUSDC.mainnet);
            const orderSize = Math.min(
              orderSizeSupposedTo,
              balance.usdc_balance,
            );
            return {
              undefined;
            };
          } else if (val <= 0) {
            // Sell.
            const orderSizeSupposedTo =
              Math.abs(val) *
              (cluster === 'devnet'
                ? orderSizeSOL.devnet
                : orderSizeSOL.mainnet);
            const orderSize = Math.min(
              orderSizeSupposedTo,
              balance.sol_balance,
            );
            return {
              undefined;
            };
          }
        }),
        //...
```

**Need some help?** Check out these hints üëá

- Remember the `Order` object and its properties. This is what you'll need to return here.
- You'll definitely want to **sell** SOL _for_ USDC and **buy** SOL _with_ USDC
- `orderSizeSupposedTo` is guarding against placing orders which are too large for the bot to afford, but the `orderSize` itself is what the bot will use

Still not sure how to do this? No problem! The solution is below so you don't get stuck.

# üòÖ Solution

```typescript
// solution
// components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx

        //...
        Rx.map((val: number) => {
          if (val > 0) {
            // Buy.
            const orderSizeSupposedTo =
              val *
              (cluster === 'devnet'
                ? orderSizeUSDC.devnet
                : orderSizeUSDC.mainnet);
            const orderSize = Math.min(
              orderSizeSupposedTo,
              balance.usdc_balance,
            );
            return {
              side: 'buy',
              size: orderSize,
              fromToken: 'usdc',
              toToken: 'sol',
            };
          } else if (val <= 0) {
            // Sell.
            const orderSizeSupposedTo =
              Math.abs(val) *
              (cluster === 'devnet'
                ? orderSizeSOL.devnet
                : orderSizeSOL.mainnet);
            const orderSize = Math.min(
              orderSizeSupposedTo,
              balance.sol_balance,
            );
            return {
              side: 'sell',
              size: orderSize,
              fromToken: 'sol',
              toToken: 'usdc',
            };
          }
        }),
        //...
```

**What happened in the code above?**

- We use RxJS to `map` the numerical value being passed, then return an `Order` object with the appropriate values set in its properties.
- The property names contained in the returned object need to match the `Order` object: `side`, `size`, `fromToken` & `toToken`.

# ‚úÖ Make sure it works

## üê¢ Mock swaps

If you're going to use the **mock wallet**, then all you need to do is specify an amount to buy or sell in the input next to the button and click on the button next to the input to perform the swap. This will generate a mock transaction, which is _not_ sent to the Solana cluster. You can still view the order details on the order book component, however the Transaction link to the block explorer will not work.

## üêá Actual swaps

Once you've made the necessary changes to `components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx` and saved the file, the Next.js development server will hot module reload the page automatically. Once the page is reloaded, you can switch the wallet over to **live**. Clicking on the swap buttons will send an order of each type on devnet. If you're feeling brave (and if you have actual SOL in your wallet) you might try a swap on mainnet to see how smooth Jupiter can be.

---

# üèÅ Conclusion

We learned about Associated Token Accounts and SPL tokens like Wrapped SOL. We also looked at how to use the Orca and Jupiter SDKs by creating functions for exchanging SPL tokens. Using RxJS we can save a lot of hassle in how we perform the swaps, using an order book to keep track of and process the swaps.
