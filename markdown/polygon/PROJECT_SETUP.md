# Install Metamask

Make sure you have the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension installed!

# Safety disclaimers

{% hint style="info" %}
If you **ALREADY** have Metamask installed and are using it for a hot wallet, we _**strongly recommend**_ creating an entirely new wallet in Metamask for the purposes of these tutorials. Figment Learn wants nothing to do with your personal keys. We do not want any accidents involving anybody's cryptocurrency! Again, you _must not continue_ until you take care of this.  
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you **DO NOT** already have Metamask installed, welcome to the wonderful world of Web 3!  
The first piece of advice we will give you is to make _absolutely sure that you write down the_ [**Secret Recovery Phrase**](https://community.metamask.io/t/what-is-a-secret-recovery-phrase-and-how-to-keep-your-crypto-wallet-secure/3440) that is generated during Metamask's initial setup. Do not store it in a digital format. Do not share it with anybody. Please do keep it accessible to yourself, because you will be using it during the pathway.

# Add the Mumbai testnet to Metamask

The first task is to connect to the Polygon Mumbai testnet by adding it to the list of RPC endpoints in Metamask. Click on the Fox head icon in your web browser to open the popup, and then follow this workflow to complete the process :

- Click on the current network at the top of the Metamask popup (by default is says "Ethereum Mainnet")
- Scroll down and click on "Custom RPC"
- Fill in the form:
  - Network Name: `Polygon Mumbai`
  - New RPC URL: `https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com/`
  - Chain ID: `80001`
  - Currency Symbol: `MATIC`
  - Block Explorer URL : `https://mumbai.polygonscan.com`
- Double check the information, then click on the Save button.

We use the testnet for development before moving into production on the main network or "mainnet".

# ðŸ§© DataHub API keys

To make use of the Pathway content, you will require a DataHub account and a valid API key to access Polygon via DataHub's infrastructure.
You will need to [sign up for a DataHub account](https://auth.figment.io/sign_up) and verify your email address.

To use your API key you must create a new file named `.env.local` in the project root directory `/learn-web3-dapp/`, copying the contents of the existing `.env.example` file. Your API key needs to be pasted into `.env.local` so that you can authenticate your connections with DataHub.

Your personal API key can be found on the [**DataHub Services Dashboard**](https://datahub.figment.io/). Click on the **Polygon** icon in the list of available protocols and then copy your key as shown below:

You can then paste your personal API key into `.env.local`, as the value for the environment variable `DATAHUB_POLYGON_API_KEY`. This will authenticate you and enable you to make RPC requests to Polygon via DataHub:
