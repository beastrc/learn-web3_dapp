Transferring some token is one of the major feature of Web 3. In this challenge, we're going to learn how to transfer a known amount of **MATIC** to a chosen recipient. Each time a transfer occurs, we're going to re-query the new balance of our account.

# üèãÔ∏è Challenge

{% hint style="tip" %}
**Imagine this scenario:** You know you have a big balance and you want to eat some pizza. Then, you need to transfer **0.1** MATIC to buy one! In `components/protocols/polygon/challenges/transfer.ts`, implement the `transfer` function.
{% endhint %}

**Take a few minutes to figure this out.**

```typescript
//...
  try {
    const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
    const send_account = provider.getSigner().getAddress();

    const currentGasPrice = await provider.getGasPrice();
    const gas_price = ethers.utils.hexlify(
      parseInt(currentGasPrice.toString()),
    );

    const transaction = undefined;

    const hash = undefined;
    const receipt = await hash.wait();
    return {hash: receipt.transactionHash};
  }
//...
```

# üòÖ Solution

```typescript
// solution
  try {
    const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
    const send_account = provider.getSigner().getAddress();

    const currentGasPrice = await provider.getGasPrice();
    const gas_price = ethers.utils.hexlify(
      parseInt(currentGasPrice.toString()),
    );

    const transaction = {
      from: send_account,
      to: RECIPIENT,
      value: ethers.utils.parseEther(AMOUNT),
      nonce: provider.getTransactionCount(send_account, 'latest'),
      gasLimit: ethers.utils.hexlify(100000),
      gasPrice: gas_price,
    };
    const hash = await provider.getSigner().sendTransaction(transaction);
    const receipt = await hash.wait();
    return {hash: receipt.transactionHash};
  }
//...
```

**What happened in the code above?**

- First, we need to fill our transaction object with:
  - An address to send `from` (the sender).
  - An address to send `to` (the recipient).
  - The `value`, an amount which has been converted into a BigNumber (`ethers.utils.parseEther` is perfect for this)
  - A `nonce`, meaning "a number used once". This value is incremented by one for every transaction sent by an address.
  - A default `gasLimit`.
  - The current `gasPrice`.
- Finally we sign and send our transaction and wait for it to be confirmed.

# ‚úÖ Make sure it works

Once the code in `components/protocols/polygon/challenges/transfer.ts` is complete, enter an amount to transfer and click **Transfer** to send tokens to another Polygon account.

# üèÅ Conclusion

Now that we have a funded Polygon account, we can use our MATIC tokens to deploy a smart contract. In the next tutorial we will cover writing, testing and deploying the Solidity code using Truffle which is a smart contract development suite.
