Solana programs are stateless, which means they don't store the value they act on. Then how can our program keep count of the number of times it has been greeted?

We have to rely on another account to store the data - Which is why we're going to create a new account, the **greeter account** (owned by our program) in order to store the counter info.

# üèãÔ∏è Challenge

{% hint style="tip" %}
In `pages/api/solana/greeter.ts`, implement `greeter`. First, derive the **greeter** address from some values. Then create a transaction which instructs the blockchain to create the **greeter** account. You must replace the instances of `undefined` with working code to accomplish this.
{% endhint %}

**Take a few minutes to figure this out**

```typescript
//...
// Are there any methods from PublicKey to derive a public key from a seed?
const greetedPubkey = await PublicKey.undefined;

// This function calculates the fees we have to pay to keep the newly
// created account alive on the blockchain. We're naming it lamports because
// that is the denomination of the amount being returned by the function.
const lamports = await connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(
  GREETING_SIZE,
);

// Find which instructions are expected and complete SystemProgram with
// the required arguments.
const transaction = new Transaction().add(SystemProgram.undefined);

// Complete this function call with the expected arguments.
const hash = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(undefined);
//...
```

Still not sure how to do this? No problem! The solution is below so you don't get stuck.

# üòÖ Solution

```typescript
// solution
//...
const greetedPubkey = await PublicKey.createWithSeed(
  payer.publicKey,
  GREETING_SEED,
  programId,
);

const lamports = await connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(
  GREETING_SIZE,
);

const transaction = new Transaction().add(
  SystemProgram.createAccountWithSeed({
    fromPubkey: payer.publicKey,
    basePubkey: payer.publicKey,
    seed: GREETING_SEED,
    newAccountPubkey: greetedPubkey,
    lamports,
    space: GREETING_SIZE,
    programId,
  }),
);
const hash = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [payer]);
//...
```

**What happened in the code above?**

- We derive a `PublicKey` from three values: the payer of the transaction, a random seed and the programId.
- Next we call the system program `createAccountWithSeed` to create an account, passing the parameters:
  - `fromPubkey`: The account that will transfer lamports to the created account.
  - `newAccountPubkey`: Public key of the created account. Must be pre-calculated with `PublicKey.createWithSeed()`.
  - `basePubkey`: Base public key to use to derive the address of the created account. Must be the same as the base key used to create `newAccountPubkey`.
  - `seed`: Seed to use to derive the address of the created account. Defined in `GREETING_SEED`.
  - `lamports`: Amount of lamports to transfer to the created account. We calculated the minimum balance for rent exemption based on `GREETING_SIZE`.
  - `space`: Amount of space in bytes to allocate to the created account.
  - `programId`: Public key of the program to assign as the owner of the created account.
- Finally we send and await the transaction confirmation. `[payer]` in this case being the account created during the second tutorial, "Create an account".

# ‚úÖ Make sure it works

Once the code in `pages/api/solana/greeter.ts` is complete, click on **Create Greeter** to derive the greeter account from the programId and perform the transaction to create it.

# üèÅ Conclusion

Now we have an account owned by the program and dedicated to storing the program data. We are ready to go ahead and act on the data. The first natural action is to read the data. Ready?
