# Requirements

Make sure you've installed the [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)'s latest release.

> **Windows Users:** There are known compatibility issues with the Solana BPF toolchain. You will need to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Please refer to the [installation guide](https://docs.figment.io/network-documentation/extra-guides/solana-setup-for-windows) we have provided.
>
> **macOS Users:** If you are using any of the Apple Silicon products (M1 processor), you may need to build from source. [Refer to this GitHub PR for more information](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/16346/).

# 🧑‍💻 Get started

Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (you'll need `v14.17.0` or greater) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed. Then clone the repo and run the `yarn` command to install the dependencies:

```text
git clone https://github.com/figment-networks/learn-web3-dapp.git
cd learn-web3-dapp
yarn
```

# 🧩 DataHub API keys

To make use of the Pathway content, you will require a DataHub account and a valid API key to access Solana via DataHub's infrastructure.
You will need to [sign up for a DataHub account](https://auth.figment.io/sign_up) and verify your email address.

To use your API key you must create a new file named `.env.local` in the project root directory `/learn-web3-dapp/`, copying the contents of the existing `.env.example` file. Your API key needs to be pasted into `.env.local` so that you can authenticate your connections with DataHub.

> 💡 **Tip**: You can find the `.env.example` file in the root directory of the project which you just cloned: `/learn-web3-dapp/.env.example`

Your personal API key can be found on the [**DataHub Services Dashboard**](https://datahub.figment.io/). Click on the **Solana** icon in the list of available protocols and then copy your key as shown below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/figment-networks/learn-web3-dapp/main/markdown/__images__/solana/solana-setup-00.gif)

You can then paste your personal API key into `.env.local`, as the value for the environment variable `DATAHUB_SOLANA_API_KEY`. This will authenticate you and enable you to make RPC requests to Solana via DataHub:

![API keys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/figment-networks/learn-web3-dapp/main/markdown/__images__/solana/solana-setup-01.png)

Now that your API key is in place, start the Next.js development server on the default port 3000 with:

```text
yarn dev
```

# Using a Test Validator

At some point it may be useful to run a Test Validator. For example, if can't get airdrops because the Devnet faucet is not working. To run a local Test Validator, use this command in its own terminal tab or window :

```text
solana-test-validator
```

Use `solana config set` to target a particular cluster. After setting a cluster target, any future subcommands will send/receive information from that cluster. To target a running Test Validator with the Solana CLI :

```text
solana config set --url https://localhost:8899
```

You can see which cluster the Solana command-line tool (CLI) is currently targeting and the paths to your keypair and configuration file with the command :

```text
solana config get
```

# Keypair storage

During the Pathway, you will need to generate a keypair for use in the tutorials. This information is kept in the localstorage of your web browser, and is distinct from any keypairs generated by the Solana CLI. It can be accessed or cleared via the blue "Keychain" button at the top right corner of the Pathway UI, as shown below:
