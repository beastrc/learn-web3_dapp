Our contract is on-chain, and we're going to learn how to modify the value stored in the state of the contract.

Before focusing on altering a value on the smart contract, let's take a look at the fees object:

```typescript
const customFees = {
  exec: {
    amount: [{amount: '500000', denom: 'uscrt'}],
    gas: '500000',
  },
};
```

- This `customFees` object stores the predefined amount of **uSCRT** to pay in order to **execute** a write-access method of the smart contract.

# üèãÔ∏è Challenge

{% hint style="tip" %}
In `pages/api/secret/setter.ts`, implement the default function. You must replace the instances of `undefined` with working code to accomplish this.
{% endhint %}

**Take a few minutes to figure this out.**

```tsx
//...
// Increment the counter
const handleMsg = {increment: {}};
const response = undefined;
//...
```

- [**Contract example**](https://github.com/enigmampc/SecretJS-Templates/tree/master/5_contracts)
- [**`execute()`**](https://github.com/enigmampc/SecretNetwork/blob/7adccb9a09579a564fc90173cc9509d88c46d114/cosmwasm-js/packages/sdk/src/signingcosmwasmclient.ts#L409)

Still not sure how to do this? No problem! The solution is below so you don't get stuck.

# üòÖ Solution

```tsx
// solution
//...
// Increment the counter
const handleMsg = {increment: {}};
const response = await client.execute(contract, handleMsg);
//...
```

**What happened in the code above?**

- We're calling the `execute` method of the `SigningCosmWasmClient`, passing to it:
  - The `contract`, which is the contract address.
  - The `{ increment: {} }` object which represents the name of the method we are calling and the parameters we're passing to it. Again, we are passing an empty object as there are no arguments.
