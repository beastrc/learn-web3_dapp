Our Contract is on-chain, and we're going to learn how to fetch the data stored on the contract.

# üèãÔ∏è Challenge

{% hint style="tip" %}
In `pages/api/tezos/setter.ts`, implement the function and try to increment the value stored in the smart contract by one. You must replace the instances of `undefined` with working code to accomplish this.
{% endhint %}

**Take a few minutes to figure this out**

```typescript
//...
  try {
    const {network, mnemonic, email, password, secret, contract} = req.body;
    const url = getNodeUrl(network);
    const tezos = new TezosToolkit(url);

    await importKey(tezos, email, password, mnemonic, secret);

    const n = 1;
    // Load the interface of the contract
    const counterContract = undefined;
    // Call the increment function of the contract
    const transaction = await undefined;
    // Await confirmations
    await transaction.confirmation(3);

    res.status(200).json(transaction.hash);
  }
//...
```

Still not sure how to do this? No problem! The solution is below so you don't get stuck.

# üòÖ Solution

```typescript
// solution
//...
  try {
    const {network, mnemonic, email, password, secret, contract} = req.body;
    const url = getNodeUrl(network);
    const tezos = new TezosToolkit(url);

    await importKey(tezos, email, password, mnemonic, secret);

    const n = 1;
    // Load the interface of the contract
    const counterContract = await tezos.contract.at(contract);
    // Call the increment function of the contract
    const transaction = await counterContract.methods.increment(n).send();
    // Await confirmations
    await transaction.confirmation(3);

    res.status(200).json(transaction.hash);
  }
//...
```

**What happened in the code above?**

- First, we must supply the address of our newly deployed contract to `tezos.contract.at`.
- Next, using `contract.methods.increment(n).send()` will pass the value of `n` to the `increment` method of the deployed contract. Note: _if the contract functions are not annotated, they are still indexed by number._
- Next, using the instruction `transaction.confirmation(3)` we wait for **3** block confirmations before returning.
- Finally, the transaction hash is then available and we can return it to the client-side as JSON via `transaction.hash`.

# üèÅ Conclusion

Congratulations! You have completed the Tezos Pathway, all the way from connecting to Tezos to being able to deploy smart contracts! You are now empowered to learn and build on Tezos, using the dedicated infrastructure of DataHub.

Continue to explore the [LIGO API documentation](https://ligolang.org/docs/api/cheat-sheet), learn more about [Michelson](https://tezos.gitlab.io/michelson-reference/) or perhaps dive straight into the [JSON/RPC documentation](https://tezos.gitlab.io/developer/rpc.html).

If you had any difficulties following this tutorial or simply want to discuss Tezos with other developers you can join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/fszyM7K) or head over to our [community forums](https://community.figment.io).
