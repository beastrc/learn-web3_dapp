# Figment Learn - Solana Pathway

We made this app to help developers learn about Solana.

You will build a simple web client using Solana's JS SDK to interact with a Solana program (aka smart contract) that you will deploy using the Solana CLI.

Read the instructions on how to get setup over at [Figment Learn](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/solana/solana-pathway).
