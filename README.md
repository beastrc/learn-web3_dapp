# 👋🏼 What is `learn-web3-dapp`?

We made this decentralized application (dApp) to help developers learn about Web 3 protocols.

It's a Next.js app that uses React, TypeScript and various smart contract languages (mostly Solidity and Rust).

We will guide you through using the various blockchain JavaScript SDKs to interact with their networks. Each protocol is slightly different, but we have attempted to standardize the workflow so that you can quickly get up to speed on networks like Solana, NEAR, Polygon and more!

- ✅ Solana
- ✅ Polygon
- ✅ Avalanche
- ✅ NEAR
- ✅ Tezos
- ✅ Secret
- ✅ Polkadot
- ✅ Celo
- ✅ The Graph
- ✅ The Graph for NEAR
- ✅ Pyth
- 🔜 Ceramic
- 🔜 Arweave
- 🔜 Chainlink
